# Site connectivity checker
Desktop application for checking sites connection in a background mode by sending ICMP messages.

## Problem
Usually when we need some site to interact with and it crashes we have to go to this site and update the page again and again many times to check whether it is available or not. 
Instead of this we propose the desktop app which will ping the site every minute by sending ICMP messages in a background mode.
When the site become available the app will notify user.
