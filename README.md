# Site connectivity checker
Desktop application for checking site connection in a background mode by sending ICMP messages.

## Problem
Usually, when we need some site to interact with and it crashes we have to go to this site and update the page, again and again, many times to check whether it is available or not. Instead of this, we propose the desktop app which will ping the site every minute by sending ICMP messages in a background mode. When the site becomes available the app will notify the user.
